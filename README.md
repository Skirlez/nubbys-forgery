# Nubby's Forgery
W.I.P Modloader for Nubby's Number Factory

## How it works
This repository contains a GameMaker project. This project is built, and then merged into Nubby's Number Factory using an UndertaleModTool script.
This structure is what allows the project to be open-sourced (and also makes it resilient to updates!)

Mods are written using [Catspeak](https://github.com/katsaii/catspeak-lang).

To make a mod, clone the example project from TODO
